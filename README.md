**Student Name:** Mehak  
**Roll Number:** 102303792  

This project implements a Mashup Generator using Python. The system downloads multiple YouTube videos of a given singer, converts them into audio files, trims a fixed duration from each audio clip, and merges them into a single mashup file. A simple web application is also provided to perform the same task through a browser.
